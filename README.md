# Kontinuum-controller

> **Please notice:** the Kontinuum-controller is in a Proof-of-Concept stage and demos the functionality of the underlying concept. The project is not yet ready for usage in any kind of production environment.

The Kontinuum-controller projects provides a Kubernetes controller that extends the Kubernetes API to offer three simple Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that can be used by application developers to deploy their applications to a variety of clusters may they reside in the cloud, on the edge or basically anywhere. Additionally platform engineers have the possibility to offer managed components (e.g. databases, key-value stores, message-queues etc.) on the composed application platform that can be used by application teams to offload them from operations and management efforts.
